# SIM224: Reserved for SIM901 once it's stable.

Comparisons return boolean values. No need to wrap it in a bool-call.

## Config Options

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM224,SIM901
```

## Complex Form

```python
bool(a == b)
```

## Simplified From

```python
a == b
```

## Rationale

Both notations are semantically equivalent in Python 3, but the second one is shorter.
