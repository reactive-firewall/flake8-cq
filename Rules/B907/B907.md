# B907: Consider replacing `f"'{foo}'"` with `f"{foo!r}"` which is both easier to read and will escape quotes inside foo if that would appear.

The check tries to filter out any format specs that are invalid together with `!r`. If you're
using other conversion flags then e.g. `f"'{foo!a}'"` can be replaced with `f"{ascii(foo)!r}"`.
Not currently implemented for python`<3.8` or `str.format()` calls.
