SIM108: Can Simplify if-else-assign with the ternary operator.

Use the ternary operator if it's reasonable.

Config Options:
You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM108


Anti-Pattern:

if a:
    b = c
else:
    b = d


Best Practice:

b = c if a else d
