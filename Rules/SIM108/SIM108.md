# SIM108: Can Simplify if-else-assign with the ternary operator.

Use the ternary operator if it's reasonable.

## Config Options:

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM108
```

## Anti-Pattern

```python
if a:
    b = c
else:
    b = d
```

## Best Practice

```python
b = c if a else d
```
