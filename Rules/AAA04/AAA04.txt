AAA04: expected 1 blank line before Assert block, found none

For tests that have an Assert block, there must be a blank line between the Act and Assert blocks,
but Flake8-AAA could not find one.

Prerequisites:
As with rule AAA03, this rule works best with pycodestyle’s E303 rule enabled because it
ensures that there are not multiple blank lines between the blocks.

If test code is formatted with Black, then it’s best to set “large” Act block style.

Resolution:
Add a blank line before the Assert block.

Rationale:
This blank line creates separation between the action and the assertions and makes the Act block
easy to spot.
