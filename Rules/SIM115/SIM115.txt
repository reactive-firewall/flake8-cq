SIM115: Use context handler for opening files.

Using a context handler is shorter and avoids the error of forgetting to close a file handle.

Config Options:
You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM115


Anti-Pattern:

f = open(...)
... # (do something with f)
f.close()


Best Practice:

with open(..) as f:
   ... # (do something with f)
