SIM104: Use 'yield from iterable' (introduced in Python 3.3, see PEP 380)

Use 'yield from iterable' (introduced in Python 3.3, see PEP 380)

Config Options:
You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM104


Anti-Pattern:

for item in iterable:
    yield item


Best Practice:

yield from iterable
