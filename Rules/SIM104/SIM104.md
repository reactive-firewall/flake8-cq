# SIM104: Use 'yield from iterable' if possible.

Use 'yield from iterable' (introduced in Python 3.3, see PEP 380).

## Config Options:

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM104
```

## Anti-Pattern

```python
for v in g:
    yield v
```

## Best Practice

```python
yield from <expr>
```
