# E265: Block comment should start with '# '.

Block comments should have one space before the sharp sign ('#') and the comment itself.

## Anti-pattern

```python
#This comment needs a space
def print_name(self):
    print(self.name)
```

# Best Practice

```python
# Comment is correct now
def print_name(self):
    print(self.name)
```
