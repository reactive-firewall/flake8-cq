E265: Block comment should start with '# '.

Block comments should have one space before the sharp sign ('#') and the comment itself.

Anti-pattern:

#This comment needs a space
def print_name(self):
    print(self.name)


Best Practice:

# Comment is correct now
def print_name(self):
    print(self.name)
