# SIM118: explicit call to 'keys()' is already implied.

Can simplify by dropping explicit call to `keys()`.

## Config Options

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM118
```

## Complex form

```python
key in a_dict.keys()
```

## Simplified form

```python
key in a_dict
```
