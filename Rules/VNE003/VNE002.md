# VNE003: variable names that shadow builtins are not allowed.

The Flake8 plugin complaint **VNE003** indicates that variable names which shadow built-in names
are not allowed. This rule is crucial for maintaining code clarity and preventing potential bugs
that can arise from unintentional name collisions.

## Risks of Shadowing Built-ins in Python 3

Shadowing built-in names can lead to several risks, particularly in Python 3:

- **Reduced Readability**: When a variable name shadows a built-in, it can confuse developers who
  expect the built-in functionality. This can lead to misunderstandings about the code's behavior.

- **Increased Risk of Bugs**: If a built-in function or type is shadowed, any calls to that name
  will reference the variable instead of the intended built-in. This can result in unexpected
  behavior and hard-to-trace bugs.

- **Maintenance Challenges**: Code that shadows built-ins can be more difficult to maintain,
  as future developers may not realize that a variable is masking a built-in name, leading to
  potential errors during updates or refactoring.

## Rationale

The rationale behind the VNE003 rule is to promote best practices in coding by ensuring that
variable names do not conflict with Python's built-in names. This helps maintain a clean and
understandable codebase, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving collaboration among
developers.

## Problematic Code Examples

Here are some examples of code that shadow built-in names:

```python
# Example 1: Shadowing the built-in 'list'
list = [1, 2, 3]
print(list)  # This will print the list, but 'list' is now a variable, not a built-in function.

# Example 2: Shadowing the built-in 'str'
str = 42
print(str(100))  # This will raise a TypeError, as 'str' is now an integer, not a built-in function.

# Example 3: Shadowing the built-in 'max'
def find_max(max):
    return max([1, 2, 3])  # This will raise a TypeError, as 'max' is now a variable, not a built-in function.
```

## Correct Code Examples

Here are the corrected versions of the above examples, avoiding shadowing of built-in names:

```python
# Corrected Example 1: Use a different variable name
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list)  # This will correctly print the list.

# Corrected Example 2: Use a different variable name
my_str = 42
print(str(100))  # This will correctly convert 100 to a string.

# Corrected Example 3: Use a different parameter name
def find_max(max_value):
    return max([1, 2, 3])  # This will correctly return the maximum value.
```
