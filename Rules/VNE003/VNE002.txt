VNE003: variable names that shadow builtins are not allowed.

The Flake8 plugin complaint **VNE003** indicates that variable names which shadow built-in names
are not allowed. This rule is crucial for maintaining code clarity and preventing potential bugs
that can arise from unintentional name collisions.

Rationale:
The rationale behind the VNE003 rule is to promote best practices in coding by ensuring that
variable names do not conflict with Python's built-in names. This helps maintain a clean and
understandable codebase, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving collaboration among
developers.
