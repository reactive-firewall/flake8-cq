# SIM116: Can simplify many if-else with mapping.

Consider using a dictionary instead many if/elif equality checks.

## Config Options

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM116
```

## Complex form

```python
if a == "foo":
    return "bar"
elif a == "bar":
    return "baz"
elif a == "boo":
    return "ooh"
else:
    return 42
```

## Simplified form

```python
mapping = {"foo": "bar", "bar": "baz", "boo": "ooh"}
return mapping.get(a, 42)
```


## Best Practice

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Consider the trade-offs; Avoid use of function calls with the dictionary approach and avoid
> constants with the many if/else approach.
