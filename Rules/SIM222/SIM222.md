# SIM222: Use 'True' instead of '... or True'.

Simplify the tautology statement; Use `True`.

## Config Options

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM220
```

## Complex Form

```python
a or True
```

## Simplified From

```python
True
```

## Rationale

Both notations are semantically equivalent in Python 3, but the second one is shorter and faster.
