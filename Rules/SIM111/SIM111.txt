SIM111: Can simplify statement with 'all(...)'.

It's shorter.

Config Options:
You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM111


Complex form:

for x in iterable:
    if check(x):
        return False
return True


Simplified form:

return all(check(x) for x in iterable)
