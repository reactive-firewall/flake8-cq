# SIM107: Don't use return in try/except and finally.

The return value might be unexpected in a try-except-finally clause. It is better to avoid a
return in those cases

## Config Options

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM107
```

## Complex form

```python
def foo():
    try:
        1 / 0
        return "1"
    except:
        return "2"
    finally:
        return "3"
```

## Simplified form

```python
def foo():
    return_value = None
    try:
        1 / 0
        return_value = "1"
    except:
        return_value = "2"
    finally:
        return_value = "3"  # you might also want to check if "except" happened
    return return_value
```

## Best Practice

Avoid use of finally to alter the return value at all.
