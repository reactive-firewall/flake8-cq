# SIM211: Use 'not a' instead of 'False if a else True'.

Simplify the statement; Use the pythonic 'falsy' form, it reduces cognitive complexity slightly.

## Config Options

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM211
```

## Complex Form

```python
False if a else True
```

## Simplified From

```python
not a
```

## Rationale

Both notations are semantically equivalent in Python 3, but the second one is shorter and
more pythonic.
