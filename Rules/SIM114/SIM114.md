# SIM114: Duplicate blocks in conditionals.

Combine conditions via a logical or to prevent duplicating code.

## Config Options:

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM114
```

## Anti-Pattern

```python
if a:
    b
elif c:
    b
```

## Best Practice

```python
if a or c:
    b
```
