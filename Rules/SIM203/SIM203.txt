SIM203: Use 'a not in b' instead of 'not a in b'

It reduces the complexity. Both cognitively and computationally.

Complex Form:

not a in b


Simplified From:

a not in b


Rationale:
Both notations are equivalent in Python 3, but the second one is simpler. Because, Python
will treat 'not a in b' semantically as 'not (a in b)' and thus we can apply a generalization of
De Morgan's laws to the statement (hint: because 'a in b' can be generalized as with
inclusive 'or's 'a in b[i] or a in b[i+1] for all i from 0 thru len(b)'.
