# SIM300: Use 'age == 42' instead of '42 == age'.

It's way more common to have the variable first.

## Config Options

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM300
```

## Complex Form

```python
"Yoda" == i_am
```

## Simplified From

```python
i_am == "Yoda"
```

## Rationale

Both notations are equivalent in Python 3, but the second one is more pythonic.
