# N400: Found backslash that is used for line breaking.

## Anti-Patterns

### String line breaks

```python
some_string = 'first line\
second line'
```

### Logical Organization

```python
if 1 == 1 and \
    2 == 2:
    print('Do not do that!')
```

### Method Chaining

```python
some_object \
  .call_method(param1, param2) \
  .call_other(keyword=value) \
  .finalize()

```

## Best-Practices

### Strings with line breaks

Use `()` or `"""` instead

```python
some_string = (
    'first line',
    '\n',
    'second line',
)
```

**OR**

```python
some_string = """first line
second line"""

```

### Backslash-Free Organization

Use a single line, `()`, or new variables instead.

```python
if 1 == 1 and 2 == 2:
    print('Do not use backslash for short-stuff!')
```

**OR**

```python
if (
    1 == 1 and
    2 == 2
):
    print('Do not use backslash where parenthesis work!')
```

**OR**

```python
# Variables are easily organized
predicate_1_is_1: bool = 1 == 1
predicate_2_is_2: bool = 2 == 2
predicates: bool = (
    predicate_1_is_1 and
    predicate_2_is_2
    # this is easy to expand
    # with a future predicate_3_is_3
    # etc.
)

if predicates:
    print('Do keep the logic clean!')
```

### When in doubt use open-parenthesis

Most other lines can be broken into smaller lines by splitting parenthesis into
the open-parenthesis concluding the initial line, followed by the parenthesized code indented
as a new code-block, and following with the close-parenthesis starting on a new line.
For example:

```python
# Instead use:
some_objects.call_method(
    param1, param2,
).call_other(
    keyword=value
).finalize()
```
