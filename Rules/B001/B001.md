# B001: Do not use bare `except:`.

Do not use bare `except:`, it also catches unexpected events like memory errors, interrupts,
system exit, and so on. Prefer `except Exception:`.

If you're sure what you're doing, be explicit and write 'except BaseException:'.
Disable `E722` to avoid duplicate warnings.
