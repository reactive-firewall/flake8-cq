# B903: Use `collections.namedtuple` (or `typing.NamedTuple`) for data classes that only set attributes in an `__init__` method, and do nothing else.

If the attributes should be mutable, define the attributes in `__slots__` to save per-instance
memory and to prevent accidentally creating additional attributes on instances.
