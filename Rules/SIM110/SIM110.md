# SIM110: Can simplify statement with `any(...)`.

It's shorter.

## Config Options:

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM110
```

## Anti-Pattern

```python
for x in iterable:
    if check(x):
        return True
return False
```

## Best Practice

```python
return any(check(x) for x in iterable)
```
