# B101: Test for use of assert

This plugin test checks for the use of the Python `assert` keyword.
It was discovered that some projects used `assert` to enforce interface constraints.
However, `assert` is removed with compiling to optimised byte code (`python -O` producing
*.opt-1.pyc files). This caused various protections to be removed. Consider raising a
semantically meaningful error or `AssertionError` instead.

Please see
[https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement)
for more info on assert.

## Config Options:

You can configure files that skip this check. This is often useful when you use assert
statements in test cases.

```ini
  assert_used:
    skips: ['*_test.py', '*test_*.py']
```

## Example

```console
>> Issue: Use of assert detected. The enclosed code will be removed when
   compiling to optimised byte code.
   Severity: Low   Confidence: High
   CWE: CWE-703 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/703.html)
