# E302: Expected 2 blank lines, found 0.

Two blank lines are expected between functions and classes.

## Anti-pattern

```python
class classA:
    def func1():
        pass
    def func2():
        pass
```

```python
def func3():
    pass
def func4():
    pass
```

## Best practice

1. Use 1 blank line for class-member function/methods

```python
class ExampleClassA:

    def example_function1():
        pass

    def example_function2():
        pass


```

2. Use 2 blank lines for defining classes and functions

```python
class ExampleClassA:
    pass


def example_function3():
    pass


def example_function4():
    pass


```
