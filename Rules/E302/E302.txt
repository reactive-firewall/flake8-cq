E302: Expected 2 blank lines, found 0.

Two blank lines are expected between functions and classes.

Anti-pattern:

class classA:
    def func1():
        pass
    def func2():
        pass

def func3():
    pass
def func4():
    pass


Best practice:

1. Use 1 blank line for class-member function/methods

class classA:

    def func1():
        pass

    def func2():
        pass

2. Use 2 blank lines for defining classes and functions

class classA:


def func3():
    pass


def func4():
    pass
