# SIM223: Use 'False' instead of '... and False'.

Simplify the contradiction statement; Use `False`.

## Config Options

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM220
```

## Complex Form

```python
a and False
```

## Simplified From

```python
False
```

## Rationale

Both notations are semantically equivalent in Python 3, but the second one is shorter and faster.
