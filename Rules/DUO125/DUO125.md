# DUO125

This linter searches for use of the `commands` module.

Use of the `commands` module commonly allows for arbitrary code execution
bugs when combined with user input.

## Problematic code

```python
import commands

commands.getstatusoutput('ls /bin/ls')
```

## Correct code

Instead of using the `commands` module to execute commands, prefer to use the
`subprocess` module while ensuring `shell=False`.

See [Replacing Older Functions with the `subprocess` Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess-replacements).

## Rationale

Arbitrary code execution allows an attacker to perform any action within the
context of the system the bug is found. E.g. open a reverse shell to a system
of their choosing, install malware by downloading and running a payload,
silently log actions performed on the victim system, etc.

Arbitrary code execution bugs are effectively the keys to the castle. We'd
like to avoid using the above function because it commonly allows for these
types of bugs.

## Exceptions

None
