B950: Line too long.

This is a pragmatic equivalent of pycodestyle's E501: it considers "max-line-length" but only
triggers when the value has been exceeded by more than 10%. noqa and type: ignore comments are
ignored. You will no longer be forced to reformat code due to the closing parenthesis being one
character too far to satisfy the linter. At the same time, if you do significantly violate
the line length, you will receive a message that states what the actual limit is. This is
inspired by Raymond Hettinger's "Beyond PEP 8" talk and highway patrol not stopping you
if you drive < 5mph too fast. (OBLIGATORY IANAL DISCLAIMER: Obviously driving too fast is not
being recommended by this antidotal observation)

Disable E501 to avoid duplicate warnings. Like E501, this error ignores long shebangs on the
first line and urls or paths that are on their own line:

#! long shebang ignored

# https://some-super-long-domain-name.com/with/some/very/long/paths
url = (
    "https://some-super-long-domain-name.com/with/some/very/long/paths"
)
