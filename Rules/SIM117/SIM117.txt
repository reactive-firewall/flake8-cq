SIM117: Merge with-statements that use the same scope.

A little known feature of Python is that a with statement can contain multiple context managers.
This allows the code only one with statement (and therefore only 1 level of indentation).
This rule has a similar rational to SIM102.

This rule should be applied if and only if:
* context A only contains the code of Context B and no other code. That is all the code in
  the nested statement will run with context A and B.

Config Options:
You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM117


Anti-Pattern:

with A() as a:
    with B() as b:
        print('hello')


Best Practice:

with A() as a, B() as b:
    print('hello')
