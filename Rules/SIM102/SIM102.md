# SIM102: Nested `If` conditions can be simplified.

Multiple, nested, `if` conditions which can be merged into a single `if` statement by using `and`
between conditions.

## Config Options:

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM102
```

## Anti-Pattern

```python
if a:
    if b:
        c
```

## Best Practice

```python
if a and b:
    c
```
