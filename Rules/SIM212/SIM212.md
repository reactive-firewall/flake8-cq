# SIM212: Use 'a if a else b' instead of 'b if not a else a'.

Simplify the statement.

## Config Options

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM212
```

## Complex Form

```python
b if not a else a
```

## Simplified From

```python
a if a else b
```

## Rationale

Both notations are semantically equivalent in Python 3, but the second one is shorter.
