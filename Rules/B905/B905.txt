B905: zip() without an explicit strict= parameter set.

strict=True causes the resulting iterator to raise a ValueError if the arguments are exhausted
at differing lengths.

Exclusions are itertools.count, itertools.cycle and itertools.repeat (with times=None)
since they are infinite iterators.

The strict= argument was added in Python 3.10, so don't enable this flag for code that
should work on <3.10. For more information: https://peps.python.org/pep-0618/
