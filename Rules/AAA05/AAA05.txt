AAA05: blank line in block.

The only blank lines in the test must be around the Act block making it easy to spot. Flake8-AAA
found additional blank lines which break up the block’s layout.

Problematic code:

def test_a() -> None:
    x = 3

    y = 4

    result = x**2 + y**2

    assert result == 25


def test_b() -> None:
    nothing = None

    with pytest.raises(AttributeError):

        nothing.get_something()


Correct code:
Remove the blank lines.

def test_a() -> None:
    x = 3
    y = 4

    result = x**2 + y**2

    assert result == 25


def test_b() -> None:
    nothing = None

    with pytest.raises(AttributeError):
        nothing.get_something()


Rationale:
Blank lines are essential for dividing up a test. There will usually be just two blank lines in
each test - one above and one below the Act block. They serve to separate the Act block from the
rest of the test.

When there are additional blank lines in a test, then the “shape” of the test is broken and
it is hard to see where the Act block is at a glance.
