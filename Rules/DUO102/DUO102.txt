DUO102: The `random` module is not suitable for security or cryptographic uses.

This linter searches for `random` module use not using `random.SystemRandom`.
The `random` module is not suitable for security or cryptographic uses.

Problematic code:

import random
browser_cookie = random.randint(min_value, max_value)


Correct code:

from random import SystemRandom
safe_random = SystemRandom()
browser_cookie = safe_random.randint(min_value, max_value)


When using Python 3.6+ it is also advisable to use the `secrets` module.

import secrets
browser_cookie = secrets.randbelow(max_value - min_value + 1) + min_value


Rationale:

Python uses the Mersenne Twister as the core generator. However, being
completely deterministic, it is not suitable for all purposes, and is
completely unsuitable for cryptographic purposes. Because the generator is
deterministic this means attackers can predict future values given a
sufficient amount of previous values.

Exceptions:

- Normal `random` use is acceptable if the relevant code is not used for security or cryptographic purposes
