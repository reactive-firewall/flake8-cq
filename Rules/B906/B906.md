# B906: `visit_` function with no further call to a `visit` function.

This is often an error, and will stop the visitor from recursing into the subnodes of a visited
node. Consider adding a call `self.generic_visit(node)` at the end of the function. Will only
trigger on function names where the part after `visit_` is a valid `ast` type with a non-empty
`_fields` attribute. This is meant to be enabled by developers writing visitors using the `ast`
module, such as `flake8` plugin writers.
