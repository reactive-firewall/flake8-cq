# B039: ContextVar with mutable literal or function call as default.

This is only evaluated once, and all subsequent calls to `.get()` would return the same instance
of the default. This uses the same logic as
[`B006`](https://github.com/reactive-firewall/flake8-cq/Rules/B006/B006.md) and
[`B008`]((https://github.com/reactive-firewall/flake8-cq/Rules/B008/B008.md), including
ignoring values in extend-immutable-calls.
