SIM401: Use 'a_dict.get(key, "default_value")' instead of an if-block.

Dictionaries have built in methods for "fetch this value if it exists or use this default".
The pattern of checking for the key and then assigning tends to pop up here and there. It is
a good practice to validate the data exists before accessing it, but in this case it is more
complex than just using the language built-in behavior.

Complex Form:

if "my_key" in example_dict:
    thing = example_dict["my_key"]
else:
    thing = "default_value"


Simplified From:

thing = example_dict.get("my_key", "default_value")


Rationale:
Both notations are semantically equivalent in Python 3, but the second one is shorter.
