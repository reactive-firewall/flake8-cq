B017: assertRaises(Exception) and pytest.raises(Exception) should be considered evil.

They can lead to your test passing even if the code being tested is never executed due to a typo.
Assert for a more specific exception (builtin or custom), or use assertRaisesRegex (if
using assertRaises), or add the match keyword argument (if using pytest.raises), or use the
context manager form with a target (e.g. with self.assertRaises(Exception) as ex:).
