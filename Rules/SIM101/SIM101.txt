SIM101: Multiple isinstance-calls which can be merged into a single call by using a tuple.

Multiple isinstance-calls which can be merged into a single isinstance-call by using a tuple as
the second argument.

Config Options:
You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM101


Anti-Pattern:

isinstance(a, int) or isinstance(a, float)


Best Practice:

isinstance(a, (int, float))
