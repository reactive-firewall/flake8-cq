# SIM101: Multiple `isinstance` calls can be simplified.

Multiple `isinstance`-calls which can be merged into a single `isinstance`-call by using a
tuple as the second argument.

## Config Options:

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM101
```

Anti-Pattern:

```python
isinstance(a, int) or isinstance(a, float)
```

Best Practice:

```python
isinstance(a, (int, float))
```
