# SIM210: Use 'bool(a)' instead of 'True if a else False'

Simplify the statement.

## Config Options

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM210
```

## Complex Form

```python
True if a else False
```

## Simplified From

```python
bool(a)
```

## Rationale

Both notations are equivalent in Python 3, but the second one is shorter.
