# SIM109: Use a tuple to compare a value against multiple values.

Use the "in" operator and a list / tuple instead of multiple comparisons.

## Config Options:

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM109
```

## Anti-Pattern

```python
if a == b or a == c:
    d
```

## Best Practice

```python
if a in [b, c]:
    d
```
