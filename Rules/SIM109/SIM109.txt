SIM109:  Use a tuple to compare a value against multiple values.

Use the "in" operator and a list / tuple instead of multiple comparisons.

Config Options:
You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM109


Complex form:

if a == b or a == c:
    d


Simplified form:

if a in [b, c]:
    d
