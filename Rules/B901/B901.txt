B901: Using return x in a generator function used to be syntactically invalid in Python 2.

In Python 3 return x can be used in a generator as a return value in conjunction with yield from.
Users coming from Python 2 may expect the old behavior which might lead to bugs. Use native
async def coroutines or mark intentional return x usage with # noqa on the same line.
