# B028: No explicit `stacklevel` argument found.

The warn method from the warnings module uses a `stacklevel` of `1` by default. This
will only show a stack trace for the line on which the warn method is called. It is
therefore recommended to use a `stacklevel` of `2` or greater to provide more
information to the user. The check is skipped when `skip_file_prefixes` is used.
