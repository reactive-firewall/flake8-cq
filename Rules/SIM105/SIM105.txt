SIM105: Can Simplify with 'contextlib.suppress(...)' instead of try-except-pass.

Use 'contextlib.suppress(...)' instead of try-except-pass to simplify.

Caveat:
Please note that contextlib.suppress is roughly 3x slower than try/except

Config Options:
You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM105


Complex form:

try:
    foo()
except ValueError:
    pass


Simplified form:

from contextlib import suppress

with suppress(ValueError):
    foo()
