# SIM105: Can Simplify with 'contextlib.suppress(...)' instead of try-except-pass.

Use `contextlib.suppress(...)` instead of `try`-`except`-`pass` to simplify.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that `contextlib.suppress` is roughly 3x slower than `try`/`except`

## Config Options

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM105
```

## Complex form

```python
try:
    foo()
except ValueError:
    pass
```

## Simplified form

```python
from contextlib import suppress

with suppress(ValueError):
    foo()
```
