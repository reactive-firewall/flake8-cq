SIM113: Use enumerate instead of manually incrementing a counter.

Using enumerate in simple cases like the loops below is a tiny bit easier to read as the reader
does not have to figure out where / when the loop variable is incremented (or if it is incremented
in multiple places).

Config Options:
You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM113


Complex form:

idx = 0
for el in iterable:
    ...
    idx += 1


Simplified form:

for idx, el in enumerate(iterable):
    ...
