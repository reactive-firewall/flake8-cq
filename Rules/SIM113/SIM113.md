# SIM113: Use enumerate instead of manually incrementing a counter.

Using enumerate in simple cases like the loops below is a tiny bit easier to read as the reader
does not have to figure out where / when the loop variable is incremented (or if it is incremented
in multiple places).

## Config Options:

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM113
```

## Anti-Pattern

```python
for x in iterable:
    if check(x):
        return False
return True
```

## Best Practice

```python
return all(check(x) for x in iterable)
```
