# B911: `itertools.batched()` without an explicit `strict=` parameter set.

`strict=True` causes the resulting iterator to raise a `ValueError` if the final batch is shorter
than `n`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `strict=` argument was added in Python `3.13`, so don't enable this flag for code that
> should work on `<3.13`.
