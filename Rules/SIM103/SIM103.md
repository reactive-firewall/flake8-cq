# SIM103: Unnecessary if-else to return boolean.

Do not use an if-else block when you can directly return the condition.

## Config Options

You might have good reasons to ignore some flake8 rules. To do that, use the standard Flake8
configuration. For example:

```ini
[flake8]
extend-ignore = SIM103
```

## Complex Form

```python
# Bad
if condition:
    return True
else
    return False
```

## Simplified From

> [!TIP]
> Use `bool()` to maintain the semantics while simplifying the code.

```python
return bool(condition)
```

## Rationale

Both notations are semantically equivalent in Python 3, but the second one is shorter, and more
pythonic.
